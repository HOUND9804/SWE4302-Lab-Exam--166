<78>, <Switch Statement>, Using switch statement is itself a code smell
<41-42>, <Long Parameter List>, addProduct method has a long parameter list
<134>, <Conditional Complexity>, it is hard to determine that "return -1" stands for invalid order
<80, 85, 87, 91, 93>, <Magic Numbers>, Using constant numbers like 0.8
<140>, <Message Chain>, calls product via globalInventoryData class
<11-19, 24-29>, <Primitive Obsession>, the nested classes hold only variables of primitive types
<44-48>, <Nested 'if-statements'>, the try block in addProduct method has multiple nested if-statements
<104, 112, 122>, <Unused Methods>, these 3 methods aren't used anywhere in our code
<107, 116, 126>, <Conditional Complexity>, it's difficult to determine how the total price is being calculated
<NA>, <Large Class>, inventorySystem class is too large, handling multiple responsibilities, which also violates "Single Responsibility Principle"

<9-11>, <Global Data>, Using static variables
<17>, <Conditional Complexity>, The return statement is ambiguous and doesn't reflect how the discount is being calculated clearly
